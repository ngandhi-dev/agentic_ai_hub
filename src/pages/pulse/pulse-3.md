## The Big Idea

The transition from single LLM prompts to **Multi-Agent Swarms** is the most significant shift in AI since the transformer paper. Instead of one agent trying to do everything, we are seeing specialized "worker" agents managed by a "manager" agent.

### Why this matters

- **Parallelism:** Tasks that took 10 minutes can now be split among 5 agents.
- **Error Correction:** Agents can now "peer review" each other's code.
- **Reduced Hallucination:** Specialized agents stay within their narrow knowledge domain.

> "The future isn't a smarter model; it's a smarter system of models."

### The Weekly Stack Spotlight

1. **PydanticAI:** A new framework for model-agnostic agent development.
2. **CrewAI+:** Enhanced orchestration for complex workflows.
3. **OpenManus:** An open-source alternative to high-end autonomous coders.
